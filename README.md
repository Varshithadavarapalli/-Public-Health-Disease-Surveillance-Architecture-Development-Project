# Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project

## Introduction

The Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project aims to establish a robust infrastructure for monitoring and analyzing disease trends, with a focus on syndromic surveillance. This project facilitates the creation of a comprehensive system to collect, process, and analyze health data from various sources, enabling timely detection and response to potential outbreaks.

## Objectives

- **Establishing Surveillance Infrastructure:** Develop a scalable and secure architecture for collecting health data from hospitals, healthcare information exchanges (HIEs), and other relevant sources.
  
- **Implementing Syndromic Surveillance:** Integrate tools for syndromic surveillance, allowing the early detection of disease outbreaks based on patterns of symptoms reported by healthcare facilities.
  
- **Ensuring Interoperability:** Implement standards such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) to enable seamless data exchange between different healthcare systems and applications.
  
- **Enhancing Analytical Capabilities:** Develop data analytics pipelines to process and analyze health data in real-time, enabling public health authorities to generate actionable insights and respond effectively to emerging threats.

## Technologies Used

- **Virtualization:** Utilize virtual machines hosted on the MTU College of Computing Cluster to deploy various components of the surveillance architecture.
  
- **MTU-VPN:** Establish secure connections to the computing cluster using the MTU-VPN for remote access and data transmission.
  
- **Docker:** Containerize applications and services to ensure consistency across different environments and simplify deployment and management.
  
- **HAPI FHIR:** Implement the HAPI FHIR server to facilitate interoperability and standardize the exchange of healthcare data.
  
- **Synthea:** Generate synthetic patient data using Synthea to simulate disease outbreaks and test the surveillance system's effectiveness.
  
- **OpenEMR:** Deploy OpenEMR for managing electronic medical records and facilitating data exchange between healthcare providers.
  
- **Postman:** Test and interact with the HAPI FHIR REST API endpoints using Postman for efficient development and debugging.

## Challenges Faced

- **Integration Complexity:** Integrating diverse healthcare systems and data sources posed challenges in ensuring seamless interoperability and data consistency.
  
- **Security Concerns:** Addressing security vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations required robust measures for data encryption and access control.
  
- **Resource Limitations:** Optimizing system performance and scalability within the constraints of available resources, such as computing power and storage, presented challenges.
  
- **Technical Expertise:** Overcoming the learning curve associated with implementing new technologies and standards, particularly in healthcare informatics and data analytics.

## Outcomes Achieved

- **Established Surveillance Infrastructure:** Successfully deployed a scalable architecture for disease surveillance, enabling the collection and analysis of health data from multiple sources.
  
- **Implemented Syndromic Surveillance:** Integrated syndromic surveillance capabilities, allowing for the early detection and monitoring of disease outbreaks based on real-time data analysis.
  
- **Ensured Interoperability:** Implemented FHIR standards to facilitate seamless data exchange and interoperability between disparate healthcare systems and applications.
  
- **Enhanced Analytical Capabilities:** Developed data analytics pipelines and visualization tools to extract actionable insights from health data, empowering public health authorities to make informed decisions and respond effectively to public health threats.
